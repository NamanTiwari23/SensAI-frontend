# **Revolutionizing Network Penetration Testing: An LLM-Powered Automation Workflow for Societe GenerExecutive Summary**

This report details a transformative solution for network penetration testing, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to create an intelligent and automated workflow. This innovative approach represents a significant departure from traditional, often manual, and resource-intensive methods, offering a paradigm shift in how security assessments are conducted. By integrating LLMs across the entire pentesting lifecycle—from initial reconnaissance to detailed remediation suggestions—the solution enables a more proactive, adaptive, and efficient security posture.

For a leading financial institution like Societe Generale, the strategic advantages of this LLM-powered automation are substantial. The solution promises an enhanced security posture through comprehensive and consistent testing, leading to a more accurate understanding of the attack surface. It delivers significant cost and time efficiencies by automating repetitive tasks and accelerating vulnerability resolution. Furthermore, it improves the consistency and coverage of security assessments, moving beyond human variability to provide reliable and comparable results. Crucially, this workflow empowers the organization to proactively address emerging threats and maintain stringent compliance standards, aligning with the critical security requirements of the financial sector.

## **Current Landscape: Challenges in Traditional Network Penetration Testing**

Traditional network penetration testing, while essential, is frequently hampered by several persistent challenges that diminish its effectiveness and efficiency. These issues underscore the necessity for an advanced, automated solution.

### **Inconsistencies and Lack of Standardization**

A primary challenge in conventional penetration testing stems from the absence of standardized procedures and clear guidelines. This methodological variability leads to inconsistent test execution and outcomes, making it difficult to reliably identify all potential security weaknesses.1 The lack of a uniform approach means that results from different tests or different testers may not be comparable, obscuring the true scope and nature of security flaws within an organization's infrastructure.1 For a large financial institution, this inconsistency creates a significant hurdle in establishing a consistent security baseline and accurately measuring improvements in its security posture over time. The variability prevents a clear understanding of the enterprise-wide risk landscape, complicating strategic security investments and compliance reporting.

### **Limited Coverage and Scope**

Traditional security checks often lack the comprehensiveness required to cover all potential avenues an attacker might exploit. This inadequate testing coverage frequently arises from a misunderstanding or underestimation of the intricate nature of modern network, application, and system landscapes, which include everything from websites and internal systems to wireless networks and physical security elements.1 Consequently, not all security threats are identified, fostering a misplaced confidence in the system's security.1 This oversight can inadvertently create exploitable opportunities for malicious actors. The sheer volume and complexity of data within large, interconnected enterprise networks pose a significant cognitive burden for human testers, often resulting in incomplete coverage. This limitation means that critical vulnerabilities or subtle connections between systems might be overlooked, leaving an organization exposed to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks.

### **Operational Disruptions and Resource Intensity**

Penetration testing, by its very nature, can disrupt normal business operations. If testing involves critical systems or demands significant resources, it can lead to network slowdowns or temporary halts in essential services, resulting in reduced productivity and potential financial losses.1 Furthermore, traditional manual methods are inherently difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring weeks to deliver proper results.2 For financial institutions that operate around the clock, any disruption can incur substantial financial and reputational damage. The current approach forces a difficult trade-off between thorough security assessment and maintaining continuous business operations.

### **Challenges in Measuring Effectiveness and Prioritizing Risks**

Organizations frequently struggle to quantify the effectiveness of their penetration tests. It remains unclear how many threats might have been missed, or the true criticality and impact of the risks that were identified and remediated.1 Key performance indicators, such as the total number of risks discovered, the time required to fix them, and the associated remediation costs, are often difficult to track consistently.1 This inability to effectively measure and prioritize vulnerabilities leads to a cumulative "security debt," making the organization progressively more vulnerable over time. A lack of robust prioritization mechanisms often results in delayed responses to critical threats, and an abundance of false alarms from security misconfigurations can lead to alert fatigue, reducing the efficiency of Security Operations Centers (SOCs).3 Without clear metrics, security teams cannot effectively demonstrate the return on investment for their efforts or make data-driven decisions regarding resource allocation.

### **Addressing False Positives and Test Environment Limitations**

Automated security tools, while offering speed, commonly generate false positives. These erroneous alerts consume significant time and resources as technical teams investigate and attempt to remediate non-existent issues, draining valuable operational capacity.4 Compounding this, many organizations face challenges in establishing mirrored test environments that accurately reflect their production infrastructure. Such environments are crucial for conducting aggressive, "no holds barred" testing without risking live systems.4 However, setting up and maintaining these mirrored environments demands substantial upfront investments in time, money, and resources.4 The combination of false positives and the difficulty in creating realistic test environments can lead to a "boy who cried wolf" scenario in security operations, fostering alert fatigue and a reluctance to conduct the aggressive, comprehensive testing necessary to truly harden systems.

## **The Transformative Role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Cybersecurity**

Large Language Models are fundamentally reshaping the cybersecurity landscape, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional automation to provide intelligent analysis and adaptive responses.

### **LLMs as Enablers for Advanced Automation**

LLMs are revolutionizing industries by their capacity to generate human-like text and power AI-driven threat detection and response mechanisms. They excel at real-time analysis of vast quantities of security logs and patterns, enabling them to identify subtle anomalies in user activity with increased speed and accuracy, thereby enhancing threat detection capabilities.5 This advanced analytical power allows LLMs to automate many repetitive processes, such as scanning for attacks or addressing simple vulnerabilities, which frees cybersecurity teams to concentrate on more complex, high-priority strategic issues.5 Research indicates that LLM-driven vulnerability assessment tools have achieved an average reduction of 30% in false negatives, significantly improving the overall reliability of cybersecurity defenses.5 This signifies that LLMs do not merely automate tasks; they introduce a layer of cognitive automation previously exclusive to human experts, shifting the focus from simple task execution to intelligent analysis and decision-making. This capability is pivotal for establishing a more proactive and adaptive security posture within complex enterprise environments.

### **Beyond Basic Automation: Intelligent Analysis and Reasoning**

The efficacy of LLMs in complex penetration testing operations is increasingly evident due to their inherent strengths in pattern-matching, their ability to manage uncertainty in dynamic environments, and the cost-effectiveness of accessing pre-trained models.6 These models are capable of covering more advanced phases of the cyber kill chain, including sophisticated techniques like privilege escalation and lateral movement.6

A key advancement is their multi-modal or inter-context capabilities. For instance, an LLM could detect a web server during an enterprise network penetration test, then seamlessly transition to a web-testing context to perform a web-specific penetration test. They can even identify sensitive information, such as passwords within text files, and subsequently utilize this information in later stages of the penetration test.6 This ability to dynamically adapt and chain discoveries mimics the adaptive thinking of a human attacker, enabling the identification of complex, chained vulnerabilities that might be missed by traditional, siloed tools.

LLM-based agents are not limited to analyzing threats; they can also reason, plan, and interact with their environment.7 By leveraging techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or Graph-RAG, these agents can cross-reference information from multiple sources—including incident reports, threat intelligence feeds, and system logs—to produce highly complex and contextual responses.7 This capacity to fuse diverse data and generate actionable intelligence moves automation from simple scripting to an intelligent assistant, capable of handling ambiguity and making informed decisions, which is critical for the intricate security operations of a financial institution.

## **Innovative Solution Architecture: LLM-Powered Network Pentesting Workflow**

The proposed LLM-powered network pentesting workflow for Societe Generale is built upon a modular and integrated architecture, designed to provide comprehensive, intelligent, and automated security assessments.

### **System Overview and Core Components**

The solution employs a modular architecture that strategically combines established security tools with an LLM-driven intelligence layer and a robust workflow orchestration platform. This design ensures adaptability, scalability, and ease of maintenance within a demanding enterprise environment.

#### **Integration with Network Scanners (e.g., Nmap, Nessus)**

The workflow initiates by leveraging industry-standard network and vulnerability scanners. Nmap is utilized for foundational network discovery, including host identification, port scanning, and operating system detection.9 Nessus provides comprehensive vulnerability assessment, encompassing asset discovery, configuration auditing, and malware detection.9 These tools are critical for generating the raw, foundational data—such as Nmap's "grepable" results and Nessus's detailed scan outputs—that the LLM layer subsequently ingests and analyzes. Nessus, in particular, offers an extensive API that facilitates the automation of tasks like creating, launching, retrieving results, and deleting scans, ensuring seamless integration into the automated workflow.11 This hybrid approach strategically focuses LLM capabilities on the

*analysis, interpretation, and actionability* of the data, rather than on raw data collection, thereby leveraging the strengths of both traditional and AI technologies to ensure accurate and broad initial data gathering. The innovation here lies in using LLMs to make sense of the massive and complex output from these scanners, which often overwhelms human analysts, creating a powerful synergy between proven scanning capabilities and AI-driven intelligence.

#### **Workflow Orchestration Platform (e.g., n8n)**

A low-code workflow automation platform, such as n8n, serves as the central orchestration layer. This platform is responsible for connecting and coordinating various security tools, LLMs, and other enterprise systems. n8n boasts over 400 integrations and offers a wide array of pre-built SecOps templates for tasks like monitoring security advisories, analyzing phishing attempts, and conducting web security checks.15 Its design supports the creation of complex workflows, offering a cost-effective solution for frequent security assessments.16 Crucially for a financial institution, n8n is designed with security in mind, featuring encrypted data transfers, secure credential storage, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) functionality.16 Furthermore, n8n can be self-hosted, which is a significant advantage for Societe Generale, as it allows sensitive data to remain within the organization's controlled infrastructure, directly addressing paramount data sovereignty and privacy concerns.17 The choice of n8n is thus not merely for automation efficiency but for its ability to facilitate secure, private, and scalable integration of LLMs within a highly regulated enterprise environment.

#### **Local LLM Integration for Data Processing and Reasoning**

To ensure maximum data privacy and security, particularly with sensitive network data, local LLMs (e.g., Llama3, Mistral, via Ollama) are integrated into the solution.10 This setup guarantees that proprietary information and scan results do not leave the organization's premises, maintaining a robust privacy and security posture. These local LLMs are enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. RAG enables the LLMs to query external, continually updated knowledge bases—such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), various threat intelligence feeds, and internal proprietary documentation—to provide highly contextual, accurate, and up-to-date responses.7 This overcomes the inherent short-term memory limitations of LLMs and significantly enhances their problem-solving abilities. The strategic decision to use local LLMs with RAG is a critical architectural choice for Societe Generale. It directly mitigates data privacy concerns while enhancing the LLM's accuracy and relevance by providing access to enterprise-specific threat intelligence and internal knowledge, which is crucial for a financial institution's unique context and regulatory adherence. This combination maximizes both security and intelligence, ensuring that the AI-driven analysis is both secure and highly relevant.

### **Automated Workflow Stages**

The LLM-powered solution orchestrates a series of automated stages, mimicking and enhancing a human penetration tester's methodology.

#### **Automated Reconnaissance and Information Gathering**

The initial phase involves LLM-powered tools conducting comprehensive reconnaissance. These tools scan networks to identify open ports, running services, subdomains, and other potentially exploitable details.19 This includes employing passive techniques, such as querying public databases and DNS servers, to map the target environment extensively.19 Advanced automated reconnaissance capabilities extend to detecting "shadow IT" assets or unmonitored devices, providing security teams with a complete and accurate overview of all possible entry points into the network.9

#### **Intelligent Vulnerability Detection and Analysis**

Following reconnaissance, LLMs analyze the outputs from scanners like Nmap and Nessus to identify a broad spectrum of security flaws, including misconfigurations, outdated software, and weak passwords.19 They leverage extensive databases of known vulnerabilities, such as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) from the NVD, and analyze emerging threat patterns to ensure thorough detection.10 The LLMs perform AI-driven CVE analysis, automatically classifying vulnerabilities based on their risk profile. They correlate identified vulnerabilities with real-world attack techniques, referencing frameworks like MITRE ATT\&CK, to provide actionable insights that go beyond simple severity scores.3 This contextualization helps in understanding the true threat posed by a vulnerability within the specific operational environment.

#### **Dynamic Attack Path Generation and Exploitation Simulation**

Leveraging their advanced reasoning and inter-contextual capabilities, LLMs move beyond merely listing vulnerabilities to simulating dynamic attack paths. This involves anticipating potential vulnerabilities during penetration tests and suggesting actionable fixes to strengthen system security proactively.5 The LLMs can cover more sophisticated phases of the cyber kill chain, including privilege escalation and lateral movement within a compromised network.6 They adapt their testing approach dynamically based on new findings; for example, if a web server is detected, the LLM can switch to a web-testing context, or if passwords are found in text files, they can be utilized in subsequent exploitation steps.6 Furthermore, LLM-driven fuzzing techniques, such as KARTAL for web applications, Llm4Fuzz for smart contracts, and ChatAFL for network protocols, can generate novel test inputs and discover vulnerabilities more efficiently than traditional manual methods, effectively simulating real-world attacker tactics.20

### **LLM-Powered Pentesting Workflow Stages and Corresponding Tools/LLM Functions**

To provide a clear, high-level overview of the end-to-end workflow, the following table visually represents each stage, mapping it to the specific traditional tools and LLM capabilities employed. This demonstrates the seamless integration and flow of intelligence throughout the automated pentesting process.

| Stage | Traditional Tools | LLM Capabilities | Orchestration Platform (n8n) | Output/Action |

## **Addressing Key Pentesting Challenges with LLM Automation**

The proposed LLM-powered solution directly addresses the identified challenges in traditional network penetration testing, offering comprehensive improvements and strategic advantages for Societe Generale.

### **Enhanced Efficiency and Consistency**

Automated tools can conduct penetration tests significantly faster than manual methods, rapidly scanning systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and generating reports, which in turn enables quicker remediation cycles.19 The LLM-powered automation ensures consistent results because it follows the same procedures and rules every time, drastically reducing the risk of human error or oversight.19 This consistency leads to more predictable and reliable testing outcomes, simplifying the process of discovering security weaknesses and facilitating the creation of more effective solutions.1 The combination of speed and consistency allows Societe Generale to conduct frequent, standardized security assessments, which is crucial for maintaining a strong security posture in a dynamic threat landscape and demonstrating continuous improvement to regulatory bodies. This repeatable, quantifiable process provides a clear picture of the security posture, enabling better tracking of improvements over time and easier compliance reporting.

### **Optimized Resource Utilization**

Automated testing significantly reduces the need for extensive human labor, making it a more cost-effective option for frequent security assessments.2 By automating large portions of the testing process, the solution allows organizations to plan testing activities during off-peak hours, thereby minimizing disruption to critical business operations.1 LLMs can further optimize these schedules and resource allocation by intelligently managing test execution, ensuring that the impact on critical systems is negligible. This approach transforms penetration testing from a high-cost, high-disruption event into a continuous, integrated process. This shift enables Societe Generale to reallocate its valuable human security expertise from repetitive scanning and analysis tasks to higher-value activities, such as advanced threat hunting, strategic defense planning, and complex vulnerability research, ultimately optimizing the utilization of both computational and human resources and leading to significant cost savings.

### **Intelligent Vulnerability Prioritization and Risk Assessment**

The LLM-driven approach revolutionizes vulnerability prioritization and risk assessment. LLMs ingest vast amounts of security advisories, threat intelligence reports, and exploit databases to automatically classify vulnerabilities based on their real-world risk.3 They go beyond simple severity scores by correlating vulnerabilities with real-world attack techniques, referencing frameworks like MITRE ATT\&CK, to provide highly actionable insights.3 Furthermore, LLMs possess the capability for proactive risk prediction. They analyze hacker forums, security blogs, and exploit databases to detect early signs of emerging vulnerabilities, including discussions about zero-day exploits.3 The system automatically prioritizes vulnerabilities based on exploitability scores (EPSS), the business impact and criticality of affected assets, and the availability of exploit kits and discussions on the dark web, ensuring that remediation efforts are focused on the most pressing and exploitable threats.3 This capability shifts the security paradigm from reactive "patch management" to proactive "risk prediction and mitigation." For Societe Generale, this means moving beyond a reactive backlog of vulnerabilities to intelligently anticipating and addressing the most critical, exploitable threats before they can manifest as breaches, directly impacting financial stability, regulatory compliance, and overall business resilience.

### **Automated Remediation Suggestions and Patch Generation**

Beyond identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities, the LLM-powered solution provides actionable remediation guidance. LLMs can suggest the most effective ways to address specific issues found during scans, offering concrete fixes to bolster system security.5 A significant advancement is the LLM's ability to suggest AI-generated patches or configuration changes for known vulnerabilities and even auto-generate hotfix scripts, which substantially reduces the manual workload associated with patching.3 LLMs can also perform automated code and configuration security reviews, scanning codebases, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and container configurations for misconfigurations. This includes automatically detecting vulnerabilities, such as Log4j, before deployment, thereby integrating security earlier into the development lifecycle.3 The ability to auto-generate remediation steps and even code/configuration fixes effectively closes the loop between vulnerability identification and resolution, dramatically accelerating the Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR). This represents a critical efficiency gain for large enterprises with vast and complex IT infrastructures, ensuring faster security posture improvement and potentially enabling a "zero-touch remediation" approach for certain vulnerabilities, which is highly scalable for an organization like Societe Generale.

### **Comparison of Traditional vs. LLM-Automated Pentesting (Benefits & Improvements)**

The following table provides a clear, side-by-side comparison, highlighting the quantitative and qualitative improvements offered by the LLM-automated approach over traditional penetration testing methods.

| Aspect | Traditional Pentesting | LLM-Automated Pentesting |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Consistency** | Variable, dependent on human tester expertise | High, programmatic adherence to procedures 1 |
| **Coverage** | Limited, prone to human oversight in complex environments 1 | Comprehensive, AI-driven analysis of vast data 7 |
| **Operational Disruption** | High, potential for network slowdowns/service halts 1 | Low, optimized scheduling, reduced resource intensity 1 |
| **Cost** | High, due to extensive human labor and time 2 | Reduced, cost-effective for frequent assessments 2 |
| **Time to Identify/Remediate** | Weeks for results, manual remediation 2 | Days/Hours, rapid scanning, auto-generated fixes 3 |
| **False Positives** | Frequent, wasting resources on non-issues 4 | Minimized, intelligent analysis and cross-referencing 3 |
| **Prioritization** | Manual, subjective, often based on static scores 1 | AI-driven, contextual, based on exploitability/impact 3 |
| **Actionability of Results** | Raw vulnerability lists, requiring human interpretation | Actionable insights, generated remediation steps/scripts 3 |

## **Mitigating LLM-Specific Security Risks and Limitations**

While LLMs offer immense benefits in cybersecurity, their deployment introduces new attack surfaces and unique vulnerabilities that must be rigorously addressed, particularly in a high-security, highly regulated environment like Societe Generale.

### **Understanding LLM Vulnerabilities**

LLMs are susceptible to security threats common to all AI systems, such as biases, but they also pose unique cybersecurity risks inherent to their architecture and operation.24 These vulnerabilities must be carefully evaluated before deployment.

* **Prompt Injection:** Attackers can craft malicious instructions within user inputs to override the model's safety features, potentially revealing hidden data, generating harmful content, or manipulating the LLM's intended behavior.20  
* **Data Poisoning:** Adversaries may insert deceptive or biased information into the LLM's training data. This can skew model outputs, leading to incorrect or malicious security assessments and potentially compromising the integrity of the system's decisions.25  
* **Data Leakage (Model Inversion/Sensitive Information Disclosure):** Through carefully designed queries, an attacker might prompt the LLM to inadvertently disclose sensitive information from its training data or internal knowledge base. This poses a significant privacy and confidentiality risk, especially for a financial institution handling proprietary and client data.20  
* **Model Manipulation/Theft:** Attackers can attempt to replicate the model's functionality by analyzing numerous responses (known as model extraction or theft). They can also manipulate decision-making processes through unauthorized modifications or by injecting biases, which could compromise the integrity and trustworthiness of the security assessments performed by the LLM.25  
* **Insecure Output Handling:** If the LLM's output is not sufficiently validated or sanitized before being passed to other systems, it can lead to secondary vulnerabilities. This includes risks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), or providing indirect access to functionality that should be restricted.20  
* **Excessive Agency:** LLM agents with overly broad functionality or permissions, if compromised, could lead to unintended or malicious actions. This poses a risk of privilege escalation or widespread disruption within the network, emphasizing the need for carefully defined boundaries for LLM operations.26

The paradox of LLMs being powerful security tools yet possessing their own critical vulnerabilities necessitates a "security-by-design" approach for their implementation. For Societe Generale, this means treating the LLM solution itself as a high-value target that requires its own rigorous penetration testing and continuous security controls. Proactive internal security of the LLM system is as vital as the external security it provides. Any vulnerability in the LLM system could lead to catastrophic data breaches or operational disruptions, making the integrity and trustworthiness of the security automation paramount.

### **Robust Mitigation Strategies**

To counter the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs and ensure their secure deployment, especially in a high-stakes environment, a multi-layered approach to mitigation is essential.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** This is critical for preventing prompt injection attacks and maintaining the integrity of LLM operations. It involves implementing robust methods to sanitize inputs by strictly removing harmful characters, scripts, or instructions from user prompts before they reach the model.5 This ensures that only legitimate and safe inputs are processed.  
* **Secure Training Data and Model Resilience:** Organizations should avoid training or fine-tuning LLMs using sensitive or private data; where applicable, synthetic data can be used as a secure alternative.29 Safeguarding training data involves implementing differential privacy techniques, which introduce small, controlled tweaks to data to protect personal information from being inferred.25 Rigorous vetting and continuous monitoring of training data sources are necessary, along with implementing sandboxing techniques to isolate training processes and prevent unauthorized data ingestion. Adversarial training and anomaly detection methods are employed to identify and mitigate the impact of poisoned data.26 Furthermore, employing federated learning allows LLMs to be trained securely across distributed datasets without requiring the transfer of raw data to centralized servers, significantly reducing data leakage risks.27  
* **Access Controls and API Security:** Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is crucial to limit unauthorized access to LLM APIs, ensuring that only users with specific, defined permissions can interact with the system.5 Applying rate limiting on API requests helps control the frequency and volume of queries, protecting against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and attempts at model theft.25 Additionally, thorough data sanitization and filtering mechanisms must be enforced during both the training and inference stages to prevent sensitive information from being disclosed in LLM outputs.26  
* **Human-in-the-Loop Oversight and Continuous Monitoring:** A hybrid approach is advocated, integrating LLMs with human oversight. This involves multiplying verifications and specializing models rather than relying on a single, general-purpose model.7 Regular audits of LLM configurations, outputs, system prompts, and security measures are essential, including real-time monitoring and synthetic monitoring for unusual model activity to ensure proactive detection of anomalies.5 Red teaming exercises are vital; these involve simulating realistic attack scenarios against the LLM system to identify weaknesses before real-world exploitation can occur.27 The emphasis on human oversight is not a limitation of automation but a critical design principle for responsible AI deployment in high-stakes environments. It acknowledges LLM limitations, such as hallucinations and biases, and ensures that human judgment remains the ultimate arbiter for critical security decisions, balancing efficiency with safety and compliance.

## **Conclusions**

The proposed LLM-powered network penetration testing automation workflow offers a compelling and comprehensive solution to the long-standing challenges faced by traditional pentesting methods, particularly for an organization like Societe Generale. The analysis demonstrates that the solution effectively addresses issues of inconsistency, limited coverage, operational disruption, and challenges in measuring effectiveness and prioritizing risks.

By integrating established scanning tools like Nmap and Nessus with a secure, self-hosted orchestration platform such as n8n, and leveraging local LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities, the solution provides a robust, private, and intelligent automation framework. This architecture ensures that sensitive financial data remains within the organization's control while benefiting from advanced AI-driven analysis, dynamic attack path generation, and automated remediation suggestions. The ability to prioritize vulnerabilities based on real-world exploitability and business impact, coupled with the capacity to generate actionable fix recommendations, represents a significant leap towards a proactive, risk-managed security posture.

While the deployment of LLMs introduces new and unique security vulnerabilities, the report outlines a rigorous set of mitigation strategies. These include stringent input validation, secure training data practices, robust access controls, and a crucial "human-in-the-loop" oversight model. This commitment to securing the LLM system itself, through continuous monitoring and red teaming, ensures the integrity and trustworthiness of the automated security processes.

In conclusion, this LLM-automated pentesting workflow is not merely an incremental improvement but a transformative approach. It enables Societe Generale to achieve higher levels of security efficiency, consistency, and coverage, allowing for faster adaptation to emerging threats and more effective allocation of human security expertise. The solution's comprehensive nature and its focus on mitigating LLM-specific risks make it a strategic imperative for enhancing cybersecurity resilience in the dynamic financial landscape.
